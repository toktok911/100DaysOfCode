    "The thing about textblob is that it has a pre-trained algorithms. It may not work well in Arabic tweets, or it might have been trained on not very representative datasets of tweets. Who knows. I did not check the documentations very well to be honest. But if you want to start this sentiment analysis thing from the scratch and very beginning, the way to do it is by starting building your own dictionary or lexicon of words, which involves much of manual cleaning and pre-processing, and some other tedious work of assigning positive/negative/neutral labels and also training/testing using Machine Learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes for example. \n"
