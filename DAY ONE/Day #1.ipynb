This time when i logged in to create a new one, the questions that I need to answer were different, and I need to submit and wait for a confirmation at email to be able to start working with it. For my case, the email came stating that the details i gave were not enough and I need to expand more on the purposes and intentions of creating this app. I have seen an emphasis on warnings about possible usage of extracted tweets that would possible invade other users privacy. Anyway, after providing more detailing, I received the confirmation and started playing around with it.\n"
