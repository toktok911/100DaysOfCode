# 100DaysOfCode
## Let's do this
restarting the 100DaysOfCode challenge that I began last year. This time, I will focus on a better documentation of the bit and pieces that I am learning along the way, rather than focusing on how much I code everyday. Let's do this intimidating thing. 

Each folder resembles the day in the 100 days period. What I aimed for this time, and unlike the last time, is dedicating more time and days for the single topic, instead of trying different thing everyday and being messy and all over the place the way I did last year.

## Topics of interest
This time I am emphasizing on three things: 
- Becoming more familiar with the Twitter API different products, the python libraries that can help with that. In addition to twitter bots building, and twitter sentiment analysis.
- Data cleaning and data pre-processing. 
- Data visualization. 

I may add more as the challenge goes. But these three points however are more critical to me. The inspiration behind this came from the realization that I have been spending more time studying the theoritical aspects of Machine Learning Algorithms and the math involved, and so little time in the initial steps that come first and the required coding to do so. So yeah, more time on the basics. 

## Structure of the 100 days: [Up to change]
- days 1-10: On Twitter with Python. 
- days 11-20: Data cleaning & preprocessing. 
- days 21-30: Data visualization 
- days 31-40: 
- days 41-50: 
- days 51-60: 
- days 61-70:
- days 71-80: 
- days 81-90:
- days 91-100:
